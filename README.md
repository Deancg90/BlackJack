# BlackJack
An interactive game of blackjack

This is the first solo project, where I have written the entire project from scratch with little to no resources. This has
been by far a great learning experience, and a great project to do to get me out of 'tutorial hell'. It took me around a day
and a half of writing to get it into a working game.

In this project, I have learnt about: 

1. Global variables, which can be used by everyone, both inside and outside the function, I used this as after doing some
basic research on how to access these variables to then calculate who has won in the game, this needed to be done in the
BlackJack() function.

2. choice() method returns a randomly selected element, this was needed to have the cards chosen to be truely random.

3. isinstance() function, this returns True if the specified object is of the specified type. In this case, it was
to check if the card chosen is a face_card_value(str) or a card_list(int). And then i was able to iterate and sum through
both of these types of cards. This was nessaccery as i had to store the face card values in a dictionary, it took me a while
to figure this out and get the function to work. But was worth it in the end as I haven't used dictionaries since learning
about them a few months back.

Overall it was a fun project and a great learning experience. I look forward to making it better and building on 
the knowledge i have gained from writing this game. I gained alot more experience in writing functions and lots of if, elif and
else loops, along with while loops. The future plans for this project is to add a currency system, also get around
using global variables, as I have had advice on against using these, unless absolutely necessary.
